# Creating a React Front End

## 1. Why React?

- All right. So we're going to be starting off here by building the front end of our blog site using React. Now you may be wondering why we choose to use React instead of just creating our site using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Well, React has a lot of advantages over hand coding a static site. And the main advantage is that it makes creating a website much simpler and faster without taking away any of the fine grained control from the programmer.
- All right. It allows us to create modular reusable components that can then be arranged into a fully functional website instead of hand coding each individual page in our site. So let's imagine for example that we have a blog site with hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of articles such as Medium here.
- And let's say that we want to add something to all of our pages, right? Like an email signup form or in the case of Medium something that blocks users from reading articles after they've read three articles in a month. Well, if our site was just a static collection of HTML documents, what we'd have to do is actually have as many HTML documents as we had articles on our site.
- And if we wanted to make some sort of change, right? If we wanted to add a message up here saying this is your last free article, for example. Then what we would have to do is actually make that change across all of our HTML files which would be a very unpleasant and time intensive task. All right. So that's one of the main reasons that we use React is to make that sort of thing much easier.
- Now, the next question is why you'd use React over other platforms like **WordPress** or **Wix** or **Squarespace** that provide you with a more drag and drop approach to building websites usually without writing any code? Well, first of all, since this course is primarily aimed at developers, if you want to create a blog and you're not already a fairly strong developer, I would actually recommend that you use one of these platforms instead of React, since it'll probably end up being much more difficult for you in the long run, if you try and create a code based site with React if you haven't yet mastered basic coding. All right.
- So another question is why you choose React over other web libraries and frameworks like Angular or View? And the answer to this question is that it kind of depends on why you're asking, right? If you're trying to figure out which one of these React or Angular or View, or one of the many other front end libraries that are out there is best for you.
- Then I'd say that at the end of the day, the only way to really know for sure is to try all three. All right. Now, if you're trying to figure out which one you should learn for career reasons, however, I would strongly recommend React. Now, I'm not exactly sure what the actual statistics for this are.
- You're free to Google that for yourself, but personally I see a lot more companies using React than any of the other major front end libraries. Okay? So all that being said, React is a fantastic tool for programmers who want to create basically any type of web application.
- And with the advent of libraries like React Native it's rapidly becoming a tool for creating mobile apps as well. All right now, because of this React developers are currently very highly sought after and generally highly paid as well by companies who are looking to modernize their web apps or stay ahead of the curve. So with all of that knowledge, let's move on and see how we can quickly set up a React powered blog site.

## 2. Setting up a React project

- All right. So the fastest way to set up a React app from scratch is usually by using a generator, right? It is possible to create a React app from scratch without using a generator but it can be kind of a lengthy process and it involves some extra things that we're not really going to be talking about here.
- So there are several generators that you can use all of which take nearly all of the work out of getting a React site up and running which is pretty great, right? So in this video what we're going to do is use create React app, which is a not very creatively named open source React app generator which is published, I believe by Facebook. And it's currently one of the most popular and common ways to create a new React application.
- So to set up our project, what you're going to want to do is open up visual studio code or whatever IDE you're using. And you're going to want to open up the integrated terminal in your IDE. And if your IDE happens to not have an integrated terminal you'll probably just want to use eye term or something like that, or your computer's built in terminal which you can usually find by just searching for terminal. Like so, okay? So anyway, once you've opened up the terminal the next thing that you're going to want to do is navigate to wherever you want your project to be created. Right? I just have mine inside a folder called courses.
- And once you're in the right location you can create your React app by typing the following command. And it is NPX create React app. And this is going to be followed by the name of the app that you want to create, right? So since we're going to be creating a blog application here I'm going to call this my blog and we're going to hit enter and that should generate that project for us, right? So it's going to basically create a new folder called my blog and it's going to create all of the necessary React boiler plate files and install all of the necessary dependencies for us.
- And that's all there is to it. So now that we've run the create React app command what you should see if you list out your files in this directory is that we now have a new directory called my blog. And what you're going to want to do is open that up in your I D E so that we can take a look at some of the files. So let's open up courses and my blog.
- And when we click open here, we should see that, sure enough, we have a lot of files over here on the side and we'll discuss what each of these is very shortly but first let's see how to run this React app. And to do that, you're just going to want to open up a terminal and make sure that it's inside the, my blog directory or whatever you decided to call your project.
- And you're going to run NPM start, or you can also run. NPM run start. Those are really just aliases for the same command. And what that's going to do is it's going to build all of the files in our React project and host them. And you'll be able to see the React app in action, you just have to wait a minute here, in your browser at local host colon 3000. All right.
- So that's how to create and run a React app. And we were able to do all of that in a very short period of time which again is one of the major advantages of using React app generators, like create React app. So all we have to do now is modify the default code that create React app gave us in order to make it into whatever application we're trying to build.
- So let's take a quick look at the project that it's created for us, right? We saw that it created quite a few files for us inside our my blog folder. And what you're going to notice is inside this folder besides things like package dot JSON which just contains information about our project and package lock dot JSON, which is a pretty in depth look at all of the dependencies in our project.
- We also have these two folders which are called public and source. All right, now the public directory contains some of the things that create React app has put there by default, right? So you'll see this index dot HTML file which is the HTML entry point for our app.
- And you'll also see this manifest dot JSON file in here which is used with mobile phones. And I'm not going to go into too much detail on the contents of this folder here but there's plenty of information on React's website or just on the web in general, if you're interested in it. Now, the other directory that we have here, remember, is the source directory.
- And this is where the bulk of our blog's code is going to go. So we have this app dot JS component which is what's called the root component for our blog site, right? This is basically the component in React that is going to contain the rest of the components that we build. All right. Now, in addition to this main component code we also have the CSS and test files that go along with that component. And you know, those of you who are big fans of test driven development are going to have to forgive me on this but we're not actually going to be using tests in these videos.
- Since testing React projects is just beyond the scope of this course. And for the time being, we don't really need to worry about the rest of the files in this directory. It's mostly just boiler plate code that create React app has set up for us.
- All right, now you're going to notice also that there's a gitignore file inside this folder and that's there because in addition to generating all of these files for us create React app has also initialized this directory as a GitHub repo, so that, you know, as you make changes you'll be able to commit and push your code to GitHub. If that's what you want to do, of course.
