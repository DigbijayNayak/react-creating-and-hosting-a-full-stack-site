# Adding User Authentication with Firebase Auth

## 1 Why Firebase Auth?

- All right, so now that we've added MongoDB to our full stack application and we have pretty much our full front end and backend completed, the next thing that we're going to do is see how to add basic user authentication to our app. Now, adding user authentication from scratch is something that can be kind of difficult. And I actually have a course on that as well, if you want to check that out.
- So what we're going to be doing here is using a tool base called Firebase Auth or Firebase Authentication to make the job of adding Auth to our app much easier. Now, Firebase Authentication, basically what it does is it takes care of storing all of our users' information and passwords in a very secure manner for us, right. We can't even see our users' passwords. So basically this allows us to sort of piggyback off of Google's security practices, which I can almost guarantee are going to be much more strict than yours.
- Okay, so what we're going to be seeing how to do is create a Firebase Auth project and add a few users to it. And we're also going to see how to enable different sign-in methods, such as email and password sign-in. And then of course, we're going to see how to integrate all of this into our React app and also into our Node.js backend. So that's Firebase Auth, let's jump right in and get started.

## 2 Creating a Firebase project

- All right. So now that we've learned a little bit about what Firebase off is and why it can be helpful for us, the first thing that we're going to do here is we're going to set up a Firebase project so that we'll be able to link this project to our front and back ends as you'll see how to do later on. So what you're going to want to do is go to **console.firebase.google.com** and if you don't already have a Google account you're going to need to create one first of all. And once you've done that you might need to do some additional pieces of setup.
- Google will basically walk you through all of that just by going to this URL here. But anyway, after you've done all that setup what you should be able to do is see this screen here. And what we're going to want to do is add a new project. So we'll just click on this button here that says, add project. And your screen here might look a little bit different than mine, just because I have a lot of projects already on Firebase and you probably won't at this point.
- So let's just click on this add project button and what this is going to do is ask us for a few different pieces of information about our project. So the first one it's going to ask us is for a project name and you can really call this whatever you want, as long as it doesn't conflict with another project that you have. But in our case, let's just call it My React Blog. And then down here, what you're going to see is that Firebase automatically generates a random ID that incorporates this name into it.
- All right, and you can actually edit that as well but this does have to be unique across all of the projects on Firebase. So anyway, once we've typed that in, we're going to click the continue button and this is going to ask us if we want Google analytics enabled for our project. Now Google analytics is a very useful tool, but for now just to keep things simple and because we're not going to be talking about it at all, we're going to turn that off. And then we'll click on create project and we're going to see this little loading spinner while Firebase creates our project for us. And this should only take a few seconds here.
- Once it's done, we're going to see this little continue button and we'll just click on that. And that will take us to the console for our project. Now there's obviously a lot of stuff in this console here but don't worry too much about it because the only thing that we're really going to be using is this authentication thing over here. So what we're going to do is just click on authentication and that's going to bring us to the authentication console where we're going to click this get started button which should enable Firebase authentication for our project.
- Now in Firebase off, Firebase off provides a lot of different ways for us to allow users to authenticate in our applications, such as with their Google account, with their game center account, Microsoft account, et cetera. There's lots of options here, but for now, just to keep things simple, what we're going to do is use email password authentication.
- So what you're going to want to do is click on this under native providers. And that'll bring up this little window here that has different types of email password authentication that are available to us. And we're only going to enable this first one up here which is just basic email password authentication. So let's click on enable here and click save. And now we've turned on email password authentication for our project. Okay.
- So the next thing that we're going to want to do is go into this user's tab inside Firebase off and we're going to create a test user that we can use to actually log into our application once we add this to our front end react app. So what you're going to want to do is click add user and that's going to come up with a little modal window here that asks us for our email and password. And these don't have to actually be a real email and password.
- So I'm just going to enter in shaun@gmail.com and the password here, I'm just going to do Abc123 and we'll click add user. And that will create a new user for us. Now, remember what that password is because you're going to need it to log in later when we actually add Firebase off to our react app. But for now that should be all the basic setup that we have to do in order to get our Firebase project created and get Firebase off, up and running.
