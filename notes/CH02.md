# Creating a Node.js Back End

## 1. Why Node.js?

- All right, so now that we've got our client side working nicely, it's time to start building the backend of our blog. And to do this, we're going to be using Node.js. Now, you've probably already heard about Node.js by now and you should have it installed locally on your computer.
- If you don't, you're going to want to head to nodejs.org and download the Long Term Support or current version of Node.js. And Node.js is really important for us because it allows us to write our backend in JavaScript instead of in PHP or Python or Java.
- Right, as I said in the introduction, it used to be that in order to be a full stack developer you had to be fairly fluent in more than one programming language, but with Node.js, which has become an incredibly popular framework since it was released, our entire web application can now be written in JavaScript, which is great news for JavaScript developers like us.
- Now, there are many different npm packages that can be used to create Node.js servers. And the one we're going to be using in these videos is called Express. Now, Express is a great choice for us because it's unopinionated, it's very easy to get started with, and it's also very well documented and you can feel free to take a look at the documentation for Express just by going to expressjs.com and looking at the API reference.
- And in addition to this, there are a ton of third-party add-ons that can be used to extend Express's functionality, which, as we'll see later on, can really come in handy. So without further ado, let's get started creating our backend with Node.js in Express.
