# Hosting a Full-Stack React Application

## 1. Preparing an app for release

- All right, so at this point, our full stack app is pretty much finished, which means that we can move on to actually seeing how to release this app and host it somewhere on the internet, so that anyone can access it. So what we're going to be doing here is preparing our app for release, and this is going to involve a few things.
- The first thing that we're going to have to do is actually build our frontend here, and have it hosted by our backend, right? So, first of all, the way that we build our frontend is by changing directories into our frontend directory, in case you're not already there, and running the command npm run build.
- Now, what this will do is it'll take all of the developer friendly code that we've been working with so far and turn it into browser friendly code and basically all of that code is going to be put into this build folder that you just saw up here over here on the left. All right, so once this is done, what we're going to want to do is move this build folder into our backend, so that our node server can be the one that actually serves all of these files, all right? Currently, while we've been developing the frontend, it's just been Reacts built-in development server that's been hosting our app for us.
- But in production, we're going to need to actually have it hosted by our node server. So, what you're going to want to do is, copy this build folder and go into my-blog-backend and we're going to paste this folder inside here. Now, if you're using GitHub for your backend, you're probably going to want to add this build folder to your gitignore and to do that, you just need to go in here and add build and you should see that turn gray, which means that it won't get committed. Okay, so now that we've built our frontend and we've added it to our backend folder, what we're going to do is have our node server actually serve those files statically.
- So here's what that's going to look like. The first thing that we're going to need to do is tell express to use that build folder as a static folder. And to do that, we just need to say app.use express.static. And then for the path that we specify, we're going to say path.join, and then we're going to have double underscore directory name, and we're going to join that together with ../build. All right, now, because we added type module to our package .json file. This underscore underscore directory name thing, unfortunately won't work by default.
- So what we have to do, and this is a little bit of a pain, but up here at the top of our server, we just need to say import file to URL path, or file URL to path, rather. And then we're going to say const underscore underscore file name equals file URL to path import.meta.URL. And then under that, we're going to say, const underscore underscore directory name equals path.directory name and we're going to pass the file name to that. And additionally we also need to import the path package from no JS. So we'll say import path from path, and don't worry too much about all the details of what's going on here.
- Just know that what we're doing here is recreating the underscore underscore directory name thing that's available when the type is not equal to module. So anyway, this should work now. And the other thing that we're going to have to do is add a route handler specifically for when we receive a request that isn't to one of our API routes. So what this is going to look like is we're going to say app.get, and for the path here we're actually going to have to use a regular expression. Now, the reason for this what this regular expression is going to allow us to do is handle any request that doesn't go to one of our API routes, all right? So that's why we started all of these routes with slash API is so that it would give us an easy way to tell our API routes apart from when someone's using a browser and just trying to open up one of our pages that we're hosting now.
- So anyway, what this is going to look like and you're going to have to type this exactly. It's going to be slash caret symbol parentheses. And then inside here we're going to have question mark exclamation point. Yes, I'm serious about this. And then we're going to have back slash, forward slash API and then we're going to close those parentheses and say .plus/. All right, so this will basically just handle all the routes that don't start with API. That's all you need to know about that regular expression there.
- So now that we have that for the route handler we're just going to say request and response. And inside here we're just going to say response.send file path.join. And the path here is going to be underscore underscore directory name. And we're going to say ../build/index.html. So all that this is doing here is whenever a browser sends a request to our server, that isn't going to the API route, we're going to send back the index.html file, which will take care of loading our react script and rendering our react app, okay? So that's what's going on there and what we should be able to do now, excitingly enough, is run our server and be able to access our react app simply by sending a request to our server.
- All right, so what we can do is let's change directories into our backend. Write My blog backend. And if we run NPM run dev, now, what we should see is that our server is now listening. And now if we go into a browser and paste, local host, 8,000 and hit enter, we can now see our react app being rendered in our browser, even though the request that we sent was to our server, right? So the server's sending back the index.html file and that's taking care of loading our react script and rendering our app in the browser.
- All right, so let's just take a look around to make sure that everything is working and it looks like everything is still working. So the next thing that we're going to need to do is make a change to our server so that the run time we'll be able to tell it what port it should listen on. Right, this is going to be very important when we publish our server to some sort of hosting platform because usually hosting platforms like to be able to tell the server what port it should listen on.
- So what we're going to do for that is we're just going to say const port equals, and then we're going to take a look at process.environment .port. And this will just allow the hosting platform to specify the port that our app should listen on as an environment variable. Now, obviously in development mode we're just going to want that to be 8,000. So we'll provide a default value of 8,000 for that. And now we just need to go in here and replace 8,000 with port and the same thing here. We're going to say, server is listening on port and then we'll add the port number to the end of that.

  ```js
  import path from "path";

  import { fileURLToPath } from "url";
  const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
  const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../build")));
  app.get(/^(?!\/api).+/, (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../build/index.html"));
  });

  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;
  ```
