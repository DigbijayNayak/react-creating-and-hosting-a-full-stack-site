            React has become one of the most popular front-end JavaScript libraries in recent years, and for good reason. It's efficient, scalable, and can be used to build complex web applications with ease. But with so many resources available, it can be challenging to know where to start when learning React. In this article, we'll explore the fastest way to learn React, so you can start building applications with confidence.`,

        text: (
          <>
            First, you need to install Node.js on your computer. You can
            download the latest version of Node.js from the official website
            &nbsp;<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>.
            Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

        subTitle: "Step 2: Create a new folder",
        text: (
          <>
            Create a new folder for your Node server project. Open your terminal
            or command prompt and navigate to the folder. You can use the cd
            command to navigate through folders.
          </>

      },
      {
        subTitle: "Step 3: Initialize the project",
        text: (
          <>
            Run the following command in the terminal to initialize the project:
            <pre className="code-snippet">
              <code>
                <b>npm init -y</b>
              </code>
            </pre>
            This command creates a <b>package.json</b> file for your project.
            The <b>package.json</b> file contains information about your
            project, including the dependencies you'll be using.

      {
        subTitle: "Step 4: Install dependencies",
        text: (
          <>
            Now you need to install the dependencies for your Node server. In
            this example, we'll be using the express package, which is a popular
            Node.js web framework. <br />
            <br />
            Run the following command in the terminal to install the
            <b>express</b> package:
            <pre className="code-snippet">
              <code>
                <b>npm install express</b>

        subTitle: "Step 5: Create the server file",
        text: (
          <>
            Create a new file called <b>server.js</b> in your project folder.
            This file will contain the code for your Node server. <br /> <br />
            Open the <b>server.js</b> file and add the following code:
            <pre className="code-snippet">
              <code>
                <b>
                  {`
      const express = require('express');
      const app = express();

      app.get('/', (req, res) => {
            res.send('Hello, World!');
      });

      app.listen(3000, () => {
            console.log('Server running on port 3000');
      });
`}
                </b>
              </code>
            </pre>
          </>

      },
      {
        subTitle: "Step 6: Start the server",
        text: (
          <>
            Run the following command in the terminal to start the server:
            <pre className="code-snippet">
              <code>
                <b>node server.js</b>
              </code>
            </pre>
            This command starts the Node server and logs a message to the
            console indicating that the server is running.
          </>
        ),
      },
      {
        subTitle: "Step 7: Test the server",
        text: (
          <>
            Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should
            see a "Hello, World!" message. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, you've
            built a Node server in just 10 minutes! This is just the beginning,
            there's a lot more you can do with Node.js and the express package.
            Keep learning and building!
